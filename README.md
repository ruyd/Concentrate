Multi-Monitor Selective Focus Enhancements for Edge/Chrome

Instant Monitor Blinders to Enhance Focus
 
When using 3 monitors gray out the sides to focus on the center screen 
or gray out 1 side screen to avoid peripheral information from distracting you. Lighting quick to keep your focus sharp.

Or just a better "Netflix mode" with grayed out side screens
