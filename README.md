# Concentrate

Reading a lot of sites and studying a bit?

It's harder than it has to be with so much competition for your attention.

This add-on grew from a safe way to fight distractions and interruptions to a surprisingly helpful companion.

I really hope it also helps your studies and peace of mind.
