# Concentrate

Reading a lot and or studying a bit on YouTube without Premium?

Me too but it's incredibly hard with all the advertising desperately competing for your attention.

This add-on grew from that necessity until it became an incredibly helpful tool.

I really hope it helps your studies and peace of mind too.
